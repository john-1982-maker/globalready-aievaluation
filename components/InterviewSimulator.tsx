  {
    id: "p1_q1",
    phase: 1,
    phaseName: "Resume & Experience Validation",
    weight: "15%",
    question: "Welcome to your virtual assessment. I have parsed your onboarding profile. To kick off, walk me through your background. Which previous professional experiences or personal attributes best prepare you to handle strict formatting compliance, high-volume text analysis, and demanding remote deadlines?",
    idealKeywords: ["experience", "detail", "attention", "quality", "writing", "evaluation", "meticulous", "deadline", "remote"],
    sampleExcellentAnswer: "My background in quality review has trained me to approach data with rigorous precision. I am accustomed to reviewing documents against detailed rubrics under tight deadlines. This analytical workflow directly maps to the demands of AI evaluation, where keeping track of multi-step prompt requirements and detecting subtle compliance shifts separates elite performance from general output.",
    challengeQuestion: "Fascinating. Attention to detail is indeed a major differentiator. In multi-turn chat annotation, suppose a user updates their formatting preferences halfway through the conversation, creating an explicit contradiction with the initial instructions. How do you decide which instructions to hold the model accountable for?",
    challengeKeywords: ["latest", "recent", "priority", "contradiction", "context tracking", "update", "state"],
    sampleExcellentChallengeAnswer: "In multi-turn conversations, I always prioritize the most recent instruction provided by the user. While the model must remember historical context, the latest user input overrides prior preferences. I would evaluate the model based on its compliance with this updated state, and explicitly document this context-shift in my evaluation rationale."
  },
  {
    id: "p2_q1",
    phase: 2,
    phaseName: "AI Knowledge Assessment",
    weight: "15%",
    question: "Excellent. Let's move to Phase 2: Technical AI Prep. Explain RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) in simple terms to a non-technical stakeholder, and describe how it fundamentally differs from Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Why is human feedback so critical in this process?",
    idealKeywords: ["rlhf", "sft", "human feedback", "reward model", "fine-tuning", "policy", "preferences", "alignment", "safety"],
    sampleExcellentAnswer: "SFT is like teaching an AI student by showing them perfect examples to copy (labeled demonstration data). RLHF is like letting the AI generate several drafts, having human evaluators rate which drafts are best (pairwise preferences), and using those ratings to train a 'Reward Model' that acts as an automated teacher to guide the AI toward helpful, aligned, and safe behaviors.",
    challengeQuestion: "You've captured SFT vs RLHF well. But consider this critical bottleneck: what happens if human evaluators themselves are not calibrated, leading to noisy or contradictory preference data? How does this impact the Reward Model, and what steps can we take as evaluators to prevent it?",
    challengeKeywords: ["noisy", "calibration", "rubric", "consistency", "agreement", "guidelines", "bias"],
    sampleExcellentChallengeAnswer: "Uncalibrated human data creates contradictory labels, which degrades the Reward Model's capability to learn a clean reward signal, causing model alignment to fluctuate. As evaluators, we prevent this by strictly adhering to the objective project rubric rather than personal bias, discussing borderline cases during calibration reviews, and thoroughly documenting our rationales with concrete prompt evidence."
  },
  {
    id: "p3_q1",
    phase: 3,
    phaseName: "Scenario-Based Interview",
    weight: "35%",
    question: "Very thorough. Let's enter Phase 3: Work Scenarios. Suppose you are evaluating a coding prompt requesting a highly optimized script. Model A generates a highly efficient, perfect script but completely misses a minor logging format requirement. Model B follows all instructions perfectly (including the logging formatting) but writes a highly suboptimal, slow O(N^2) algorithm. How would you rank these, and how would you professionally justify your decision?",
    idealKeywords: ["instruction following", "negative constraint", "functional", "correctness", "efficiency", "compromise", "guideline", "partial compliance", "suboptimal"],
    sampleExcellentAnswer: "I would rank Model B higher if strict 'Instruction Following' is the primary metric of the rubric, as a failure to comply with a prompt constraint is a major issue. However, in functional coding, a highly inefficient script is practically useless. I would rate Model B as 'Fully Compliant but substandard efficiency' and Model A as 'Partially Compliant but high utility.' I would rank Model B higher under strict constraint rubrics, but document both issues clearly so the developers can optimize Model B's code.",
    challengeQuestion: "That trade-off is central to RLHF calibration. Suppose the company's internal directive for this specific project is 'absolute customer trust and functional reliability over strict instruction compliance'. Would this directive change your ranking, and how would you professionally defend it in a calibration meeting?",
    challengeKeywords: ["trust", "reliability", "utility", "change", "priority", "performance", "rationalize", "evidence"],
    sampleExcellentChallengeAnswer: "Yes, under an 'absolute customer trust and functional reliability' directive, I would reverse my ranking to favor Model A. A highly suboptimal O(N^2) algorithm risks server timeouts and crashes, violating functional reliability. I would defend ranking Model A higher by arguing that while it missed a minor logging constraint, its core utility is pristine, making it far safer for customer trust than Model B's slow performance."
  },
  {
    id: "p4_q1",
    phase: 4,
    phaseName: "Live AI Evaluation",
    weight: "25%",
    question: "Outstanding response. Let's move to Phase 4: Live AI Evaluation. For this exercise, I have loaded a Spanish translation task with a negative constraint. Review the prompt, translations, and negative constraints below. Submit your preference ratings, flags, and a professional rationale. Be prepared to defend your decisions.",
    idealKeywords: ["present tense", "verbs", "negative constraint", "Model B", "Model A", "tense violation", "bulleted", "bold", "translation"],
    sampleExcellentAnswer: "Model B is superior because it fully complies with the negative constraint to 'only use verbs in the present tense' (using 'madruga' and 'consigue'). Model A completely failed this constraint by using past and future tenses ('madrugó', 'atrapará'), which constitutes a major instruction following failure, despite having a more common literal phrasing. Model B also satisfies all formatting instructions perfectly.",
    challengeQuestion: "You selected Model B. However, a calibration reviewer argues: 'Model A should be ranked higher because its translation is much more common and natural in standard Spanish literature, and minor grammar constraints shouldn't override fluid prose.' How would you professionally refute this argument?",
    challengeKeywords: ["negative constraint", "constraint compliance", "guideline", "refute", "rubric", "accuracy", "strict"],
    sampleExcellentChallengeAnswer: "I would respectfully disagree with the reviewer. In professional alignment evaluation, negative constraints are non-negotiable filters. Allowing a model to bypass negative constraints simply because of 'prose flow' trains the model to be untrustworthy when handling critical security, safety, or formatting instructions. Model B proves that present tense compliance is fully achievable, so its minor flow compromise is acceptable."
  },
  {
    id: "p5_q1",
    phase: 5,
    phaseName: "Behavioural & Work Style",
    weight: "10%",
    question: "Exceptional defense. Let's finish with Phase 5: Behavioural Fit. AI evaluation is highly repetitive and requires deep focus over 8+ hour shifts. Describe a situation where your attention to detail made a major difference under pressure, and share your personal strategies for avoiding 'lazy rating syndrome' (satisficing) over hundreds of evaluations.",
    idealKeywords: ["repetition", "breaks", "satisficing", "checklist", "accuracy", "fatigue", "rubric", "active auditing", "structure"],
    sampleExcellentAnswer: "To fight fatigue, I treat every prompt as an independent, binding contract. I break my shifts into 50-minute blocks with 10-minute active resets. I use a personal checklist for common hidden traps (such as subtle mathematical errors or negative constraints) instead of relying on memory, and I write out my rationales iteratively as I audit, which keeps my critical thinking active and calibrated.",
